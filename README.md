# lambdify
Simplified AWS Lambda Development for Kotlin and Java 8.

## What is Lambdify?
The main goal of this project is provide an easy environment to create serverless applications through the AWS Lambda API. 
Lambdify consists of:
- A Maven-Plugin to deploy your uber-jar as a Lambda Application
- An API Gateway router to receive and handle requests from multiple endpoints at the same Lambda Application.

Worth to notice that despite of Lambdify being mainly written in Koltin, it can perfectly be used to design Java8 applications.

## Documentation
A well writen documentation wasn't finished yet. But you can get some inspirations at the sample
AWS project available at the `samples` directory.
